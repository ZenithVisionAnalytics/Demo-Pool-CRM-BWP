3. **Currently Listed (Matched)**: Confirmed pool addresses on the market
4. **Currently Listed (Probable)**: Properties mentioning pools currently listed

Features per tab:

- **Outreach Tracking** for sold listings:
  - Checkbox to mark properties as "reached out"
  - Automatic date stamping
  - Persistent storage across sessions

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL database access (for data collection)

### Setup

1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Configure environment variables in `app_data/utils/.env`:
```env
LAT_MIN = 43.7
LAT_MAX = 43.9
LON_MIN = -80.5
LON_MAX = -79.5
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host/database
DISTILLED_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/master_pool_db_distilled
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

Start the Streamlit app:
```bash
cd app
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at:
- Local: http://localhost:8501
- Network: http://[your-ip]:8501

### Data Collection

The application uses static CSV files that are refreshed weekly. To update data:

```bash
cd app/app_data/utils
python get_listings_data.py
```

This script will:
1. Fetch current and removed listings from the real estate database
2. Cross-reference with known pool addresses
3. Preserve existing user interaction data (reached_out flags)
4. Generate updated CSV files and summary JSON
5. Include pool metadata (type, cover type, discovery date)

### Data Files

Generated data files in `app/app_data/`:
- `listings_summary.json`: Aggregate statistics and bounding box
- `address_df.csv`: All pool addresses with metadata
- `matched_current_listings.csv`: Currently listed, confirmed pools
- `matched_removed_listings.csv`: Recently sold, confirmed pools
- `deduped_current_less_matched.csv`: Currently listed, probable pools
- `deduped_removed_less_matched.csv`: Recently sold, probable pools
- `user_interactions.json`: User outreach tracking data (persists across refreshes)

   - Updates all CSV files
   - Preserves "reached out" flags

3. Application automatically loads new data on next visit
   - User tracking persists across refreshes
   - No manual intervention needed

### User Interaction Flow

1. Navigate to "Listings" page
2. Open "Recently Sold" tabs
3. Review properties and filter as needed
4. Check "Reached Out" for contacted properties
5. Click "💾 Save Outreach Data" to persist changes
6. Data survives weekly refreshes
